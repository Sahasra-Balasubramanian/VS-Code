    <h1>My first website in VS code
    </h1>
    <h2>Why VS code?
    </h2>
    <p>Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like
        IntelliSense code completion and debugging.
    </p>
    <p>VS Code includes enriched built-in support for Node.js development with JavaScript and TypeScript, powered by the
        same underlying technologies that drive Visual Studio. VS Code also includes great tooling for web technologies
        such as JSX/React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, and JSON
    </p>
